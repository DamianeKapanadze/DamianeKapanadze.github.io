  The Renzo Piano Foundation has an internship program called a Bottega, which in Italian translates to workshop or learning by doing. Selected students work with teams on specific projects for six months, where they have to make decisions and take responsibilities, bridging the gap from academic knowledge to actually working on something.

  <h1>Renzo Piano TED Talk Quotes</h1>
  <blockquote>
    “Architecture is the art of making shelter for communities, not just for individuals -- communities and society at large. And society is never the same. The world keeps changing. And changes are difficult to swallow by people. And architecture is a mirror of those changes. Architecture is the built expression of those changes.”
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Making a building... a place for people is good. Making libraries, making concert halls, making universities, making museums is good, because you create a place that's open, accessible. You create a building for a better world, for sure.”
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “Light is probably one of the most essential materials in architecture.”
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “This beauty -- this universal beauty, I should say -- is one of the few things that can change the world. Believe me, this beauty will save the world. One person at a time, but it will do it.”
  </blockquote>
